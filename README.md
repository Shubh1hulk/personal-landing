# Shubhranshu Pandey — Recreated Static Site

This folder contains a recreated static version of the website (HTML/CSS/JS) modeled after the original. It intentionally uses placeholder SVGs and neutral assets.

How to view locally (PowerShell):

1. Change to the folder:

```powershell
cd cloned_sites\shubhranshu_pandey
```

2. Serve with Python's simple HTTP server (recommended):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or just open `index.html` in your browser (some features like form focus work better when served).

Notes:
- This is a recreated static site for local hosting and development. Replace `assets/profile.png` with a real profile image if desired.
- If you want, I can initialize a git repo here and create a branch for the recreated site.
